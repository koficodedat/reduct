# Migration Strategy for Optimized Data Structures

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the current implementations of Immutable List and Functional Map to the optimized versions.

## 1. Implementation Approach

### 1.1 Parallel Implementation

We will implement the optimized data structures in parallel with the existing ones:

- `PersistentVector` alongside the current `List`
- `HAMTMap` alongside the current `ImmutableMap`

This allows us to develop and test the new implementations without disrupting the existing codebase and enables performance comparisons between the old and new implementations.

### 1.2 API Compatibility

The new implementations will maintain the same public API as the current ones:

- All method names and signatures will remain the same
- All behavior will be preserved, with only performance characteristics changing
- Type definitions will be compatible

**Note:** Since the library has not been released yet, we don't need to maintain backward compatibility. Once we've confirmed performance improvements across all functions, we can safely remove the old data structures.

## 2. Migration Phases

### 2.1 Phase 1: Implementation and Testing

In the first phase, we'll implement the new data structures and thoroughly test them against the existing ones:

- Implement `PersistentVector` and `HAMTMap`
- Create comprehensive test suites for both implementations
- Run performance benchmarks to compare old and new implementations
- Ensure all functionality is preserved with improved performance

### 2.2 Phase 2: Integration

In the second phase, we'll update the existing classes to use the new implementations internally:

```typescript
// Current API remains the same
export class List<T> {
  // Internally uses PersistentVector
  private readonly vector: PersistentVector<T>;

  constructor(elements: ReadonlyArray<T>) {
    this.vector = PersistentVector.from(elements);
  }

  // All methods delegate to the vector
  get(index: number): Option<T> {
    return this.vector.get(index);
  }

  // ...other methods
}
```

This approach:
- Maintains the same public API
- Provides immediate performance benefits
- Allows for easy comparison with the original implementation

### 2.3 Phase 3: Direct Replacement

Once we've confirmed performance improvements across all functions, we'll replace the old implementations entirely:

```typescript
// Simply export the optimized implementations with the original names
export { PersistentVector as List } from './optimized/persistent-vector';
export { HAMTMap as ImmutableMap } from './optimized/hamt-map';
```

Alternatively, we may choose to export both the original names and new names:

```typescript
export { PersistentVector as Vector, PersistentVector as List } from './optimized/persistent-vector';
export { HAMTMap as Map, HAMTMap as ImmutableMap } from './optimized/hamt-map';
```

This completes the migration process.

## 3. Documentation

### 3.1 Migration Guide

We'll provide a comprehensive migration guide that includes:

- Explanation of the performance benefits
- Code examples showing how to migrate
- Potential edge cases to be aware of
- Benchmarks comparing old and new implementations

### 3.2 API Documentation

We'll update the API documentation to:

- Highlight the optimized implementations
- Document performance characteristics
- Provide usage examples
- Note any subtle behavioral differences

### 3.3 Code Snippets

We'll provide code snippets demonstrating:

- Basic usage of the optimized implementations
- Migration from old to new implementations
- Performance-sensitive patterns to adopt
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Compatibility Testing

We'll ensure compatibility through:

- Comprehensive unit tests that run against both implementations
- Property-based tests to verify equivalent behavior
- Integration tests with dependent packages

### 4.2 Performance Testing

We'll validate performance improvements through:

- Micro-benchmarks for individual operations
- Macro-benchmarks for realistic usage scenarios
- Scalability tests with varying data sizes
- Memory usage analysis

## 5. Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Implementation | Weeks 1-4 | Develop optimized implementations |
| Internal Testing | Weeks 5-6 | Test and refine implementations |
| Benchmarking | Week 7 | Comprehensive performance testing |
| Phase 2 Integration | Week 8 | Update existing classes to use new implementations internally |
| Documentation | Week 9 | Update documentation with performance characteristics |
| Phase 3 Replacement | Week 10 | Replace old implementations with optimized versions |

## 6. Contingency Plan

If significant issues are discovered during implementation or testing:

1. Identify the root causes of the issues
2. Determine whether to fix the optimized implementations or explore alternative approaches
3. If necessary, continue using the current implementations until the issues are resolved
4. Adjust the timeline accordingly

Since the library has not been released yet, we have flexibility to ensure the optimized implementations meet all requirements before finalizing them.
