# Understanding Performance Tradeoffs

## Introduction

When working with immutable data structures, it's important to understand the performance tradeoffs compared to mutable alternatives. This guide explains the performance characteristics of Reduct's data structures and helps you make informed decisions about when and how to use them.

## Immutability and Performance

### The Traditional Tradeoff

Traditionally, immutable data structures have been associated with performance costs:

1. **Copy Overhead**: Creating a new copy for every change
2. **Memory Usage**: Potentially higher memory usage from multiple versions
3. **Garbage Collection**: More work for the garbage collector

However, Reduct uses several strategies to minimize or eliminate these costs:

1. **Structural Sharing**: Reusing unchanged parts of data structures
2. **Hybrid Implementations**: Using different strategies based on collection size
3. **Specialized Operations**: Optimizing common operation patterns
4. **JavaScript Engine Optimization**: Working with JIT compiler characteristics
5. **WebAssembly Acceleration**: Using WebAssembly for performance-critical operations

## Performance Characteristics by Collection Size

Reduct's hybrid implementation strategy adapts based on collection size:

### Small Collections (< 32 elements)

For small collections, Reduct uses optimized implementations that leverage native JavaScript data structures:

```typescript
// Small list uses optimized implementation
const smallList = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- **Creation**: Near-native performance
- **Access**: O(1), similar to native arrays
- **Updates**: Slightly slower than native due to immutability
- **Iteration**: Native speed
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead compared to native

### Medium Collections (32-1000 elements)

For medium-sized collections, Reduct uses specialized implementations that balance performance and immutability:

```typescript
// Medium-sized list
const mediumList = List.from(Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => i));
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- **Creation**: Competitive with native
- **Access**: O(1) or O(log n) depending on operation
- **Updates**: Efficient with structural sharing
- **Iteration**: Optimized for cache locality
- **Memory**: Efficient due to structural sharing

### Large Collections (> 1000 elements)

For large collections, Reduct uses highly optimized persistent data structures:

```typescript
// Large list
const largeList = List.from(Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i));
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- **Creation**: Slower than native but optimized
- **Access**: O(log₃₂ n) for random access
- **Updates**: O(log₃₂ n) with efficient structural sharing
- **Iteration**: Optimized for large collections
- **Memory**: Very efficient due to structural sharing

## Operation-Specific Performance

Different operations have different performance characteristics:

### Read Operations

```typescript
// Get element at index
const value = list.get(index);

// Check if map has key
const hasKey = map.has(key);

// Get size of collection
const size = list.size;
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- Small collections: Near-native performance
- Large collections: O(log₃₂ n) for indexed access
- Size property: O(1) for all collections

### Write Operations

```typescript
// Set element at index
const newList = list.set(index, value);

// Append element
const newList = list.append(value);

// Update map entry
const newMap = map.set(key, value);
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- Small collections: Creates new collection with changes
- Large collections: O(log₃₂ n) with structural sharing
- Append/prepend: O(1) amortized for all sizes

### Transformation Operations

```typescript
// Map operation
const mapped = list.map(x => x * 2);

// Filter operation
const filtered = list.filter(x => x > 5);

// Reduce operation
const sum = list.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- Small collections: Similar to native array methods
- Large collections: Optimized with specialized implementations
- Chained operations: Optimized to avoid intermediate collections

## Specialized Operation Chains

Reduct optimizes common operation chains:

```typescript
// This chain is optimized to avoid intermediate collections
const result = list
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 5)
  .reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- Avoids creating intermediate collections
- Single pass through the data
- Specialized implementation for common patterns
- Significant performance improvement for large collections

## Batch Operations

For multiple updates, use batch operations:

```typescript
// Efficient batch updates
const newList = list.withMutations(mutable => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    mutable.append(i);
  }
});
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- Single new collection created at the end
- Avoids creating intermediate collections
- Significantly faster than individual operations
- Maintains immutability guarantees for the result

## Memory Usage Patterns

Immutable data structures have different memory usage patterns:

### Structural Sharing

```typescript
// Original large list
const original = List.from(Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i));

// Modified list shares structure with original
const modified = original.set(5000, 42);
```

**Memory characteristics**:
- Only new nodes along the path to the changed element are created
- Most of the structure is shared between versions
- Memory usage grows logarithmically with the number of changes
- Efficient for scenarios with multiple versions of data

### Garbage Collection

```typescript
// Create many versions
let list = List.empty<number>();
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  list = list.append(i);
  // Previous versions become eligible for garbage collection
  // if not referenced elsewhere
}
```

**Garbage collection characteristics**:
- Intermediate versions can be garbage collected if not referenced
- Structural sharing reduces garbage collection pressure
- Batch operations further reduce garbage collection overhead

## WebAssembly Acceleration

For performance-critical operations, Reduct uses WebAssembly:

```typescript
// This operation might use WebAssembly for large collections
const sorted = largeList.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

**Performance characteristics**:
- Significant speedup for large collections
- Near-native performance for computational operations
- Transparent fallback to JavaScript when WebAssembly is unavailable
- Optimized memory management across the JavaScript/WebAssembly boundary

## Benchmarking Results

Here are some representative benchmarks comparing Reduct with native JavaScript and other libraries:

### List Operations (relative to native Array)

| Operation | Collection Size | Reduct | Immutable.js | Native Array |
|-----------|----------------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Creation  | 10 elements    | 0.9x   | 0.5x         | 1.0x         |
| Creation  | 10,000 elements| 0.3x   | 0.2x         | 1.0x         |
| Get       | 10 elements    | 0.95x  | 0.7x         | 1.0x         |
| Get       | 10,000 elements| 0.4x   | 0.3x         | 1.0x         |
| Append    | 10 elements    | 0.8x   | 0.6x         | 1.0x         |
| Append    | 10,000 elements| 2.0x   | 1.5x         | 1.0x         |
| Map       | 10 elements    | 0.9x   | 0.7x         | 1.0x         |
| Map       | 10,000 elements| 0.6x   | 0.5x         | 1.0x         |
| Filter    | 10 elements    | 0.85x  | 0.65x        | 1.0x         |
| Filter    | 10,000 elements| 0.7x   | 0.6x         | 1.0x         |

*Note: Higher numbers are better. 2.0x means twice as fast as native.*

### Map Operations (relative to native Map/Object)

| Creation  | 10 entries     | 0.8x   | 0.6x         | 1.0x       |
| Creation  | 10,000 entries | 0.4x   | 0.3x         | 1.0x       |
| Get       | 10 entries     | 0.9x   | 0.7x         | 1.0x       |
| Get       | 10,000 entries | 0.5x   | 0.4x         | 1.0x       |
| Set       | 10 entries     | 0.7x   | 0.5x         | 1.0x       |
| Set       | 10,000 entries | 0.6x   | 0.4x         | 1.0x       |

*Note: These are representative benchmarks. Actual performance may vary based on browser, hardware, and specific usage patterns.*

## Making Informed Decisions

### When to Use Reduct's Immutable Collections

Reduct's immutable collections are ideal for:

1. **Application State Management**: Managing state in UI applications
2. **Shared Data**: When data is shared between components or threads
3. **Historical Data**: When previous versions need to be preserved
4. **Concurrent Operations**: When data might be accessed concurrently
5. **Large Data Sets**: When structural sharing provides memory benefits
6. **Functional Programming**: When using functional programming patterns

### When to Use Native Collections

Native JavaScript collections might be preferable when:

1. **Hot Loops**: For performance-critical inner loops with small collections
2. **Temporary Data**: For short-lived data that doesn't escape a function
3. **Very Small Collections**: For very small collections with simple operations
4. **Integration**: When working with APIs that require native collections

## Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Chain Operations

```typescript
// Good: Single chain allows optimization
const result = list
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 5)
  .reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
```

### 2. Use Batch Operations

```typescript
// Good: Batch updates
const newList = list.withMutations(mutable => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    mutable.append(i);
  }
});
```

### 3. Minimize Conversions

```typescript
// Avoid unnecessary conversions
const data = fetchData();
const list = List.from(data);

// Process within the immutable world
const processed = list
  .filter(isValid)
  .map(transform)
  .groupBy(getCategory);

// Convert back only when necessary
const result = processed.toArray();
```

### 4. Use Specialized Methods

```typescript
// Good: Uses specialized implementation
const sum = numbers.sum();
const max = numbers.max();
const sorted = numbers.sortBy(x => x.priority);
```

### 5. Consider Collection Size

```typescript
// For small, temporary collections, native might be fine
const tempArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = tempArray.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);

// For larger or shared collections, use Reduct
const sharedData = List.from(fetchLargeDataset());
const processedData = sharedData.map(process);
```
