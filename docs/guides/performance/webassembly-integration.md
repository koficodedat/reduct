# WebAssembly Integration Guide

## Introduction

Reduct leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) to accelerate performance-critical operations while maintaining the benefits of functional programming. This guide explains how Reduct's WebAssembly integration works and how it enhances performance.

## What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format that provides near-native performance for web applications. It allows code written in languages like Rust, C++, or AssemblyScript to run in the browser or Node.js environment with high performance and security.

Key benefits of WebAssembly include:

- **Near-native performance**: Much faster than JavaScript for computational tasks
- **Predictable performance**: Consistent execution times
- **Memory efficiency**: Direct memory management
- **Language agnostic**: Can be compiled from various languages
- **Security**: Runs in a sandboxed environment

## How Reduct Uses WebAssembly

Reduct uses WebAssembly selectively to accelerate performance-critical operations:

1. **Large Collection Operations**: Operations on large collections that benefit from low-level optimization
2. **Computationally Intensive Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and other algorithms
3. **Bulk Transformations**: Map, filter, reduce, and other transformations on large collections
4. **Specialized Numeric Operations**: Operations that benefit from SIMD and other low-level optimizations

```javascript
// This operation might use WebAssembly for large collections
const sorted = largeList.sort((a, b) => a - b);

// This chain of operations might use WebAssembly
const result = largeList
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);
```

## Transparent Integration

Reduct's WebAssembly integration is completely transparent to users:

- **Same API**: The API is identical whether using WebAssembly or JavaScript
- **Automatic Selection**: Reduct automatically selects the best implementation
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Falls back to JavaScript when WebAssembly is unavailable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Uses WebAssembly when available but doesn't require it

```javascript
// Same code works with or without WebAssembly
const list = List.from(myLargeDataset);
const result = list.sort().map(x => x * 2).filter(x => x > 10);
```

## Implementation Details

### WebAssembly Module Loading

Reduct loads WebAssembly modules dynamically:

```javascript
// Simplified internal implementation
async function loadWasmModule(name) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/wasm/${name}.wasm`);
    const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
    const module = await WebAssembly.compile(buffer);
    const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(module, importObject);
    return instance.exports;
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('WebAssembly module loading failed, using JS fallback');
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Memory Management

Reduct uses efficient memory management strategies for WebAssembly:

1. **Shared Memory**: For large data structures to minimize copying
2. **Structural Sharing**: To maintain immutability efficiently
3. **Specialized Allocators**: For immutable data structure operations
4. **Explicit Deallocation**: For deterministic resource management

### JavaScript/WebAssembly Boundary

Crossing the JavaScript/WebAssembly boundary has overhead, so Reduct:

- Minimizes the number of boundary crossings
- Batches operations to amortize crossing costs
- Keeps data in WebAssembly memory for sequences of operations
- Uses shared memory for large data structures

## Performance Benefits

WebAssembly integration provides significant performance benefits for certain operations:

| Operation | Collection Size | Performance Improvement |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Sort      | 10,000 elements | Up to 10x faster       |
| Map       | 100,000 elements| Up to 5x faster        |
| Filter    | 100,000 elements| Up to 4x faster        |
| Reduce    | 100,000 elements| Up to 6x faster        |
| Search    | 1,000,000 elements| Up to 20x faster     |

*Note: Actual performance improvements vary based on browser, hardware, and specific operations.*

## Browser Compatibility

Reduct's WebAssembly integration works in all modern browsers:

| Browser | Minimum Version | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Chrome  | 57+            | Full support |
| Firefox | 52+            | Full support |
| Safari  | 11+            | Full support |
| Edge    | 16+            | Full support |
| Node.js | 8.0+           | Full support |

For older browsers, Reduct automatically falls back to JavaScript implementations.

## Best Practices

### 1. Let Reduct Handle the Implementation Details

Don't worry about whether an operation uses WebAssembly or not:

```javascript
// Just use the collection - Reduct will choose the best implementation
const result = largeList.sort().map(x => x * 2);
```

### 2. Batch Operations for Large Collections

For large collections, batch operations to minimize JavaScript/WebAssembly boundary crossings:

```javascript
// Good: Single operation chain
const result = list
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);

// Less efficient: Multiple separate operations
const mapped = list.map(x => x * 2);
const filtered = mapped.filter(x => x > 10);
const result = filtered.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);
```

### 3. Use Specialized Methods

Use specialized methods that are optimized for WebAssembly:

```javascript
// Good: Uses specialized WebAssembly-accelerated implementation
const sorted = numbers.sortNumeric();

// Less efficient: Generic sort with comparator
const sorted = numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

### 4. Consider Collection Size

WebAssembly acceleration provides the most benefit for large collections:

```javascript
// Small collection: WebAssembly overhead might outweigh benefits
const smallResult = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).map(x => x * 2);

// Large collection: WebAssembly provides significant benefits
const largeResult = largeList.map(x => x * 2);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Explicit WebAssembly Control

For advanced users, Reduct provides options to control WebAssembly usage:

```javascript
// Disable WebAssembly for specific operations
const result = list.map(x => x * 2, { useWasm: false });

// Force WebAssembly for specific operations (falls back if unavailable)
const result = list.map(x => x * 2, { useWasm: true });

// Configure global WebAssembly settings
Reduct.config.setWebAssemblyEnabled(true);
```

### Custom WebAssembly Functions

Advanced users can provide custom WebAssembly functions:

```javascript
// Register custom WebAssembly function
Reduct.registerWasmFunction('myCustomSort', myWasmModule.exports.customSort);

// Use custom function
const sorted = list.sort({ algorithm: 'myCustomSort' });
```

## Conclusion

Reduct's WebAssembly integration provides significant performance benefits for large collections and computationally intensive operations while maintaining the simplicity and elegance of functional programming. By selectively using WebAssembly where it provides clear benefits, Reduct delivers high-performance immutable data structures and algorithms that work well across all modern browsers.
