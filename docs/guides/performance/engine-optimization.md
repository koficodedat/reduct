# JavaScript Engine Optimization Guide

## Introduction

Reduct takes a unique approach to functional programming in JavaScript by working with JavaScript engines rather than against them. This guide explains how Reduct leverages JavaScript engine optimizations to deliver high-performance immutable data structures and algorithms.

## Understanding JavaScript Engines

Modern JavaScript engines like V8 (Chrome, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari) use sophisticated Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques to optimize JavaScript code. These optimizations include:

- **Hidden Class Optimization**: Tracking object shapes for efficient property access
- **Inline Caching**: Caching property lookups for repeated access patterns
- **Function Inlining**: Replacing function calls with the function body
- **Type Specialization**: Generating optimized code for specific types
- **Deoptimization**: Falling back to slower execution when assumptions are violated

## How Reduct Leverages Engine Optimizations

### Adaptive Implementation Strategy

Reduct uses different implementations based on collection size and usage patterns:

```javascript
// Small collections use native arrays with immutable wrappers
const smallList = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Large collections use specialized persistent data structures
const largeList = List.from(Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i));
```

The transition between implementations is transparent to users but provides optimal performance across different scenarios.

### Size-Based Optimization

Different collection sizes have different performance characteristics:

- **Small Collections** (< 32 elements): Use native arrays/objects with immutable wrappers
- **Medium Collections** (32-1000 elements): Use specialized implementations
- **Large Collections** (> 1000 elements): Use highly optimized persistent data structures

```javascript
// All these use the same API but different internal implementations
const tiny = List.of(1, 2, 3);                                // Native array wrapper
const medium = List.from(Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => i));  // Chunked array
const large = List.from(Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i)); // Persistent vector trie
```

### JIT-Friendly Code Patterns

Reduct's internal implementations use JIT-friendly code patterns:

- **Monomorphic Code**: Consistent object shapes and function calls
- **Hidden Class Stability**: Predictable property access patterns
- **Type Stability**: Avoiding type changes in variables
- **Inlining-Friendly Functions**: Small, specialized functions

### Specialized Operation Chains

Reduct detects and optimizes common operation chains:

```javascript
// This is automatically optimized to avoid creating intermediate collections
const result = list
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);
```

## Engine-Specific Optimizations

### V8 (Chrome, Node.js)

V8-specific optimizations in Reduct include:

- Hidden class optimization for object property access
- Monomorphic call site optimization
- Efficient array iteration patterns
- Specialized numeric operations

### SpiderMonkey (Firefox)

Firefox-specific optimizations include:

- Shape teleporting for prototype-based objects
- Type inference-friendly code patterns
- Optimized property access patterns
- Warp-friendly function implementations

### JavaScriptCore (Safari)

Safari-specific optimizations include:

- Value profiling-friendly code
- B3 JIT compiler optimization patterns
- Structure ID stability
- Tier-up friendly implementation

## WebAssembly Acceleration

For performance-critical operations, Reduct uses WebAssembly:

```javascript
// This operation might use WebAssembly for large collections
const sorted = largeList.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

WebAssembly is used selectively where it provides clear benefits, with transparent fallbacks to JavaScript implementations when WebAssembly is not available.

## Best Practices for Using Reduct

### 1. Use the Right Collection Size

Let Reduct handle the implementation details based on collection size:

```javascript
// Don't worry about implementation details
// Reduct will choose the most efficient implementation
const list = List.from(myData);
```

### 2. Leverage Operation Chains

Chain operations to enable specialized optimizations:

```javascript
// Good: Allows operation fusion
const result = list
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);

// Less optimal: Intermediate variables prevent fusion
const mapped = list.map(x => x * 2);
const filtered = mapped.filter(x => x > 10);
const result = filtered.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);
```

### 3. Use Specialized Methods

Reduct provides specialized methods for common operations:

```javascript
// Good: Uses specialized implementation
const sum = list.sum();

// Less optimal: Generic reduce operation
const sum = list.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
```

### 4. Leverage Transient Operations for Batch Updates

Use transient operations for batch updates:

```javascript
// Good: Uses efficient transient operations internally
const newList = list.withMutations(mutable => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    mutable.set(i, i * 2);
  }
});

// Less optimal: Creates 1000 intermediate collections
let newList = list;
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  newList = newList.set(i, i * 2);
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Collection Creation

| Collection Size | Performance Characteristics |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Small (< 32)    | Near-native performance    |
| Medium (32-1000)| Slightly slower than native|
| Large (> 1000)  | Optimized for immutability |

### Common Operations

| Operation | Small Collections | Large Collections |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Access    | O(1), near-native | O(log₃₂ n)        |
| Update    | O(n), optimized   | O(log₃₂ n)        |
| Append    | O(n), optimized   | O(1) amortized    |
| Prepend   | O(1), faster than native | O(1)       |
| Iteration | Native speed      | Chunked for cache efficiency |
