4. **Custom Visualizations**: API for creating custom visualizations of profiling data
5. **Custom Analysis**: System for implementing specialized analysis algorithms
6. **Custom Recommendations**: Framework for creating optimization recommendation engines

## API Design Principles

1. **Minimal Overhead**: Profiling should have minimal impact on performance when enabled
2. **Zero Overhead**: Profiling should have zero overhead when disabled
