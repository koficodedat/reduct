### API Design

The WebAssembly package will provide a consistent API for other Reduct packages to consume, with enhanced support for tiered optimization:

```typescript
// Accelerator tiers for optimization strategy
export enum AcceleratorTier {
  // Always use WebAssembly (significant performance benefit)
  HIGH_VALUE = 'high-value',

  // Use WebAssembly conditionally (based on input characteristics)
  CONDITIONAL = 'conditional',

  // Prefer JavaScript (WebAssembly overhead outweighs benefits)
  JS_PREFERRED = 'js-preferred'
}

// Tiering strategy for determining when to use WebAssembly
export interface TieringStrategy<T> {
  // Function that determines if input qualifies for HIGH_VALUE tier
  [AcceleratorTier.HIGH_VALUE]?: (input: T) => boolean;

  // Function that determines if input qualifies for CONDITIONAL tier
  [AcceleratorTier.CONDITIONAL]?: (input: T) => boolean;

  // Function that determines if input qualifies for JS_PREFERRED tier
  [AcceleratorTier.JS_PREFERRED]?: (input: T) => boolean;
}

// Core API
export interface Accelerator<T, R> {
  // Execute the accelerated operation
  execute(input: T): R;

  // Check if the accelerator is available in the current environment
  isAvailable(): boolean;

  // Get performance characteristics of the accelerator
  getPerformanceProfile(): PerformanceProfile;

  // Determine the appropriate tier for the given input
  determineTier(input: T): AcceleratorTier;

  // Get performance statistics for this accelerator
  getPerformanceStats(): AcceleratorPerformanceStats;
}

// Performance statistics for an accelerator
export interface AcceleratorPerformanceStats {
  // Number of times each tier was used
  tierUsage: Record<AcceleratorTier, number>;

  // Average execution time for each tier
  averageExecutionTime: Record<AcceleratorTier, number>;

  // Input size distribution for each tier
  inputSizeDistribution: Record<AcceleratorTier, number[]>;
}

// Extended options for accelerator creation
export interface AcceleratorOptions {
  // Element type for specialized implementations
  elementType?: string;

  // Required WebAssembly features
  requiredFeatures?: WebAssemblyFeature[];

  // Tiering strategy for this accelerator
  tiering?: TieringStrategy<any>;

  // Default thresholds for common operations
  thresholds?: {
    // Minimum array size for using WebAssembly
    minArraySize?: number;

    // Minimum string length for using WebAssembly
    minStringLength?: number;

    // Minimum matrix size for using WebAssembly
    minMatrixSize?: number;
  };
}

// Get an accelerator for a specific operation
export function getAccelerator<T, R>(
  domain: 'data-structures' | 'algorithms' | 'math' | string,
  type: string,
  operation: string,
  options?: AcceleratorOptions
): Accelerator<T, R>;

// Register a custom accelerator
export function registerAccelerator<T, R>(
  domain: string,
  type: string,
  operation: string,
  accelerator: Accelerator<T, R>,
  options?: AcceleratorOptions
): void;

// Check if WebAssembly is supported in the current environment
export function isWebAssemblySupported(): boolean;

// Check if specific WebAssembly features are supported
export function isFeatureSupported(feature: WebAssemblyFeature): boolean;

// Benchmarking utilities with tiering support
export function benchmark<T, R>(
  jsImplementation: (input: T) => R,
  wasmImplementation: Accelerator<T, R>,
  input: T,
  options?: BenchmarkOptions
): BenchmarkResult;

// Find optimal threshold for switching between JS and WASM
export function findOptimalThreshold<T, R>(
  jsImplementation: (input: T) => R,
  wasmImplementation: Accelerator<T, R>,
  generateInput: (size: number) => T,
  sizeRange: [number, number],
  steps: number
): number;
```

### Integration Example with Tiered Optimization

```typescript
// In @reduct/data-structures
import { getAccelerator, AcceleratorTier } from '@reduct/wasm';

export class List<T> {
  // ...

  map<R>(fn: (value: T, index: number) => R): List<R> {
    // Get the accelerator for the map operation
    const accelerator = getAccelerator<T[], R[]>(
      'data-structures',
      'list',
      'map',
      {
        elementType: typeof this.get(0),
        // Define tiering strategy
        tiering: {
          // Tier 1: Always use WebAssembly for numeric arrays over 100,000 elements
          [AcceleratorTier.HIGH_VALUE]: (input) => {
            return typeof input[0] === 'number' && input.length >= 100000;
          },
          // Tier 2: Use WebAssembly for arrays over 20,000 elements
          [AcceleratorTier.CONDITIONAL]: (input) => {
            return input.length >= 20000;
          },
          // Tier 3: Use JavaScript for everything else
          [AcceleratorTier.JS_PREFERRED]: () => true
        }
      }
    );

    // The accelerator will automatically select the appropriate implementation
    // based on the tiering strategy and input characteristics
    if (accelerator.isAvailable()) {
      const data = this.toArray();
      const tier = accelerator.determineTier(data);

      // We can also log performance data for analysis
      console.debug(`Using ${tier} implementation for map operation on ${data.length} elements`);

      const result = accelerator.execute({
        data: data,
        fn: fn
      });
      return List.from(result);
    }

    // Fall back to JavaScript implementation if WebAssembly is not available
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### WebAssembly Integration Overhead

WebAssembly calls from JavaScript incur some overhead, which can outweigh the performance benefits for very small operations. To address this:

1. **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations into a single WebAssembly call
2. **Threshold-Based Acceleration**: Only use WebAssembly for operations above a certain size
3. **Adaptive Acceleration**: Use runtime profiling to determine when to use WebAssembly

### Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial for WebAssembly performance:

1. **Minimize Copying**: Reduce data copying between JavaScript and WebAssembly
2. **Memory Pooling**: Reuse memory allocations for similar operations
3. **Specialized Memory Layouts**: Use memory layouts optimized for specific operations

### Feature Detection and Fallbacks

Not all environments support WebAssembly or specific WebAssembly features:

1. **Feature Detection**: Detect WebAssembly support at runtime
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Provide JavaScript implementations for all operations
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Use WebAssembly when available, but don't require it

## Tiered Optimization Strategy

Based on our benchmarking results, we've observed that WebAssembly doesn't always outperform native JavaScript, especially for simpler operations or smaller data sets. To maximize the benefit of our WebAssembly investment, we're adopting a tiered optimization strategy.

### Tier 1: High-Value WebAssembly Targets

These operations consistently show significant performance improvements with WebAssembly and should be our primary focus:

1. **Computationally Intensive Operations**
   - Matrix multiplication and linear algebra (3-10x speedup potential)
   - Signal processing algorithms (FFT, convolutions)
   - Complex statistical calculations (covariance matrices, PCA)
   - Neural network forward/backward propagation

2. **Large Data Processing**
   - Operations on arrays with 100,000+ elements
   - Batch processing of multiple datasets
   - Complex sorting algorithms on large collections

3. **Specialized Algorithms**
   - Compression/decompression (Huffman, LZ77)
   - Cryptographic operations
   - Path finding and graph traversal
   - Image processing algorithms

### Tier 2: Conditional WebAssembly Targets

These operations show WebAssembly benefits only under specific conditions and should use automatic switching based on input characteristics:

1. **Size-Dependent Operations**
   - Sorting (WebAssembly for n > 10,000)
   - Filtering (WebAssembly for n > 50,000)
   - Map/reduce operations (WebAssembly for n > 20,000)

2. **Complexity-Dependent Operations**
   - String operations (WebAssembly for complex patterns or long strings)
   - Regular expressions (WebAssembly for complex patterns)
   - Tree traversals (WebAssembly for deep trees)

3. **Frequency-Dependent Operations**
   - Operations called in tight loops
   - Operations that can be batched
   - Operations that can be parallelized

### Tier 3: JavaScript-Preferred Operations

These operations typically perform better in JavaScript and should only use WebAssembly in exceptional cases:

1. **Simple Operations**
   - Basic arithmetic
   - Property access and simple transformations
   - Small array operations (length < 1,000)

2. **DOM-Related Operations**
   - Operations that interact with the DOM
   - Operations that require frequent serialization/deserialization

3. **String Manipulation**
   - Simple string concatenation
   - Basic regular expressions
   - String formatting

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Automatic Tiering**
   - Implement runtime switching based on input size and characteristics
   - Use performance counters to track actual gains
   - Adjust thresholds based on real-world performance data

2. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - Use WebAssembly for the compute-intensive parts of an algorithm
   - Use JavaScript for setup, teardown, and simple operations
   - Minimize boundary crossings between JS and WASM

3. **Continuous Benchmarking**
   - Regularly benchmark against JavaScript implementations
   - Track performance across different browsers and devices
   - Update tiering strategy based on benchmark results

## Benchmarking and Profiling

### Benchmark Suite

A comprehensive benchmark suite will be created to measure the performance of WebAssembly implementations:

1. **Operation Benchmarks**: Measure performance of individual operations
2. **Scenario Benchmarks**: Measure performance in realistic usage scenarios
3. **Comparative Benchmarks**: Compare WebAssembly with JavaScript implementations

### Profiling Tools

Profiling tools will be provided to help identify performance bottlenecks:

1. **Operation Profiling**: Measure time spent in different operations
2. **Memory Profiling**: Measure memory usage and allocation patterns
3. **Call Frequency Profiling**: Identify frequently called operations

## Conclusion

The dedicated WebAssembly package will provide significant performance benefits for the Reduct library, but our benchmarking has shown that these benefits are most pronounced for specific types of operations and data sizes. By adopting a tiered optimization strategy, we can focus our WebAssembly efforts where they provide the most value while using native JavaScript where it performs better.

We have made significant progress in implementing the foundation of the WebAssembly package and creating accelerators for various operations. Our next steps will focus on implementing the tiered optimization framework and focusing on high-value targets where WebAssembly consistently outperforms JavaScript.

This strategic approach ensures that our investment in WebAssembly technology provides maximum benefit to Reduct users while maintaining the flexibility, developer experience, and performance characteristics that make JavaScript attractive. Rather than treating WebAssembly as a universal solution, we're using it as a targeted optimization tool for specific computational challenges.
