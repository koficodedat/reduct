### API Design

The WebAssembly package will provide a consistent API for other Reduct packages to consume:

```typescript
// Core API
export interface Accelerator<T, R> {
  // Execute the accelerated operation
  execute(input: T): R;
  
  // Check if the accelerator is available in the current environment
  isAvailable(): boolean;
  
  // Get performance characteristics of the accelerator
  getPerformanceProfile(): PerformanceProfile;
}

// Get an accelerator for a specific operation
export function getAccelerator<T, R>(
  domain: 'data-structures' | 'algorithms' | 'math' | string,
  type: string,
  operation: string,
  options?: AcceleratorOptions
): Accelerator<T, R>;

// Register a custom accelerator
export function registerAccelerator<T, R>(
  domain: string,
  type: string,
  operation: string,
  accelerator: Accelerator<T, R>,
  options?: AcceleratorOptions
): void;

// Check if WebAssembly is supported in the current environment
export function isWebAssemblySupported(): boolean;

// Check if specific WebAssembly features are supported
export function isFeatureSupported(feature: WebAssemblyFeature): boolean;

// Benchmarking utilities
export function benchmark<T, R>(
  jsImplementation: (input: T) => R,
  wasmImplementation: Accelerator<T, R>,
  input: T,
  options?: BenchmarkOptions
): BenchmarkResult;
```

### Integration Example

```typescript
// In @reduct/data-structures
import { getAccelerator } from '@reduct/wasm';

export class List<T> {
  // ...
  
  map<R>(fn: (value: T, index: number) => R): List<R> {
    // Get the accelerator for the map operation
    const accelerator = getAccelerator<T[], R[]>(
      'data-structures',
      'list',
      'map',
      { elementType: typeof this.get(0) }
    );
    
    // If the accelerator is available and suitable for the current data,
    // use it; otherwise, fall back to the JavaScript implementation
    if (accelerator.isAvailable() && this.size > 1000) {
      const result = accelerator.execute({
        data: this.toArray(),
        fn: fn
      });
      return List.from(result);
    }
    
    // Fall back to JavaScript implementation
    // ...
  }
  
  // ...
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### WebAssembly Integration Overhead

WebAssembly calls from JavaScript incur some overhead, which can outweigh the performance benefits for very small operations. To address this:

1. **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations into a single WebAssembly call
2. **Threshold-Based Acceleration**: Only use WebAssembly for operations above a certain size
3. **Adaptive Acceleration**: Use runtime profiling to determine when to use WebAssembly

### Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial for WebAssembly performance:

1. **Minimize Copying**: Reduce data copying between JavaScript and WebAssembly
2. **Memory Pooling**: Reuse memory allocations for similar operations
3. **Specialized Memory Layouts**: Use memory layouts optimized for specific operations

### Feature Detection and Fallbacks

Not all environments support WebAssembly or specific WebAssembly features:

1. **Feature Detection**: Detect WebAssembly support at runtime
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Provide JavaScript implementations for all operations
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Use WebAssembly when available, but don't require it

## Benchmarking and Profiling

### Benchmark Suite

A comprehensive benchmark suite will be created to measure the performance of WebAssembly implementations:

1. **Operation Benchmarks**: Measure performance of individual operations
2. **Scenario Benchmarks**: Measure performance in realistic usage scenarios
3. **Comparative Benchmarks**: Compare WebAssembly with JavaScript implementations

### Profiling Tools

Profiling tools will be provided to help identify performance bottlenecks:

1. **Operation Profiling**: Measure time spent in different operations
2. **Memory Profiling**: Measure memory usage and allocation patterns
3. **Call Frequency Profiling**: Identify frequently called operations

## Integration with Roadmap

The WebAssembly package will evolve alongside the Reduct library roadmap:

### Phase One Integration

- Implement core WebAssembly utilities and loaders
- Create basic accelerators for critical List operations
- Implement feature detection and fallback mechanisms
- Set up benchmarking and profiling tools

### Phase Two Integration

- Expand accelerators to cover more data structures
- Implement algorithm accelerators
- Create comprehensive adapter layer for Reduct packages
- Optimize memory management and transfer

### Phase Three Integration

- Implement advanced features like SIMD acceleration
- Explore threading capabilities (if/when available)
- Create just-in-time optimization for operation patterns
- Implement specialized accelerators for specific use cases

## Conclusion

The dedicated WebAssembly package will provide significant performance benefits for the Reduct library, particularly for computationally intensive operations. By creating a separate package with a consistent API, we can accelerate operations across the entire Reduct ecosystem while maintaining the flexibility and developer experience of JavaScript.

This plan outlines the steps needed to create the package, implement accelerators for various domains, and integrate with the Reduct ecosystem. The package will evolve alongside the roadmap, with new accelerators added as needed to support the development of new features and optimizations.
