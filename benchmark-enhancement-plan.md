# Benchmark Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the plan for expanding and rethinking the benchmark system in the Reduct library. The goal is to create a more flexible, powerful, and user-friendly benchmarking system that can be used to evaluate and compare data structures and algorithms.

## Current State

The current benchmark system has:

1. **Core benchmarking utilities**:
   - `benchmark()` function for measuring performance
   - `compareBenchmarks()` for comparing multiple implementations
   - Various data structure-specific benchmark functions (e.g., `runListBenchmarks()`)

2. **Visualization tools**:
   - Formatters for console output (`formatBenchmarkSuite()`, `formatBenchmarkComparison()`, etc.)
   - Basic exporters for CSV format

3. **Example runners**:
   - Example scripts that demonstrate how to run benchmarks
   - No dedicated CLI interface

4. **Comparison capabilities**:
   - Current comparisons were rigid (now replaced with the adapter-based system)
   - No flexible way to compare different data structures with common operations

## Enhancement Goals

1. **Create a flexible CLI interface** for running benchmarks
2. **Implement a flexible comparison system** that can compare different data structures and algorithms
3. **Enhance visualization capabilities** with multiple output formats
4. **Integrate with existing code** to ensure backward compatibility
