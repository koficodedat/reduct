# Persistent Data Structures Research

This document collects research findings on persistent data structures for the Reduct Phase Two implementation.

## 1. Immutable List Optimization

### 1.1 Trie-Based Implementations

#### Clojure's PersistentVector

Clojure's PersistentVector is one of the most well-known implementations of an optimized immutable list. It uses a 32-way branching trie structure with the following characteristics:

- **Structure**: A tree with a branching factor of 32 (tuned for modern CPU cache lines)
- **Indexing**: O(log₃₂ n) for random access, which is effectively constant time for practical sizes
- **Tail Optimization**: Maintains a small buffer for the tail of the vector for O(1) append operations
- **Structural Sharing**: Only copies the path from root to the modified node, sharing unchanged branches
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses significantly less memory than naive copying approaches

Key operations:
- `nth` (get): O(log₃₂ n)
- `conj` (append): O(1) amortized
- `assoc` (update): O(log₃₂ n)
- `pop` (remove last): O(1)

#### Scala's Vector

Scala's Vector implementation is similar to Clojure's but with some optimizations:

- Uses a 32-way branching trie structure
- Implements "relaxed radix balanced trees" for better performance on certain operations
- Provides specialized implementations for small vectors
- Optimizes for both random access and sequential operations

### 1.2 Chunking Strategies

Chunking is a technique used to improve cache locality and reduce the depth of the tree:

- **Fixed-Size Chunks**: Store multiple elements in each leaf node (typically 32 elements)
- **Cache-Aligned Chunks**: Size chunks to match CPU cache line size (typically 64 bytes)
- **Adaptive Chunking**: Adjust chunk size based on usage patterns

Benefits:
- Improved iteration performance due to better cache locality
- Reduced tree depth, improving random access performance
- More efficient memory usage

### 1.3 Lazy Operations

Lazy evaluation can significantly improve performance for transformations:

- **Lazy Map/Filter**: Defer computation until elements are accessed
- **Fusion**: Combine multiple transformations into a single pass
- **Chunked Operations**: Process elements in chunks for better cache performance

Implementation approaches:
- Iterator-based lazy evaluation
- Thunk-based delayed computation
- Transducers for efficient composition

## 2. Functional Map Optimization

### 2.1 Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT)

HAMT is the standard approach for implementing efficient persistent maps:

- **Structure**: A trie where paths are determined by hash bits
- **Bitmap Indexing**: Use bitmap indexing to compress sparse nodes
- **Path Copying**: Only copy the path from root to modified node
- **Structural Sharing**: Share unchanged branches between maps

Key characteristics:
- O(log₃₂ n) lookup, insertion, and deletion
- Efficient memory usage through structural sharing
- Good cache locality for related keys

#### Clojure's PersistentHashMap

Clojure's implementation adds several optimizations:

- 32-way branching for good cache performance
- Specialized handling for string and numeric keys
- Efficient collision resolution with linked lists
- Path compression for sparse tries

#### Scala's HashMap

Scala's implementation features:

- Specialized key type handling
- Optimized equality checking
- Efficient iteration over entries

### 2.2 Collision Resolution Strategies

Effective collision handling is crucial for map performance:

- **Chaining**: Use linked lists for collisions (simple but can degrade to O(n) in worst case)
- **Open Addressing**: Use probing sequences to find empty slots
- **Robin Hood Hashing**: Minimize the variance of probe sequence length
- **Cuckoo Hashing**: Use multiple hash functions to provide alternative locations

### 2.3 Specialized Key Types

Optimizing for common key types can significantly improve performance:

- **String Keys**: Use string-specific hash functions and equality checks
- **Numeric Keys**: Direct indexing for small integer keys
- **Custom Objects**: Support for custom hash and equality functions

## 3. Implementation Considerations

### 3.1 Memory Efficiency

- **Node Structure**: Optimize node structure for memory efficiency
- **Path Compression**: Compress paths in sparse tries
- **Small Collection Optimization**: Special case for small collections

### 3.2 Cache Locality

- **Node Size**: Tune node size to match CPU cache line size
- **Memory Layout**: Organize data for optimal cache usage
- **Prefetching**: Use prefetching hints where beneficial

### 3.3 JavaScript-Specific Optimizations

- **V8 Hidden Classes**: Design data structures to work well with V8's hidden class system
- **Array Optimization**: Leverage V8's optimized array implementation
- **Property Access**: Optimize property access patterns
- **TypedArrays**: Use TypedArrays for numeric data when appropriate

## 4. Benchmarking Considerations

When benchmarking these implementations, we should consider:

- **Operation Mix**: Test realistic mixes of operations, not just isolated operations
- **Data Characteristics**: Test with various data distributions and key types
- **Workload Patterns**: Test both random access and sequential access patterns
- **Memory Usage**: Measure both peak memory usage and steady-state usage
- **Garbage Collection**: Consider the impact on garbage collection
